/*
benefits over singly linked list:
1. can be traversed in both forward and backward direction
2. can be deleted without keeping track of previous node (in singly linked list, we need to keep track of previous node)

drawbacks:
1. requires more space for each node (extra pointer to previous node)
2. requires more operations to be performed while inserting or deleting nodes
3. more complex implementation
