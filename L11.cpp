// 11. Container With Most Water

// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

// Notice that you may not slant the container.
